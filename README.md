# 🎮 Kazoku Game

## 💸 Top Up Mechanism
Kazoku Game features a Top Up system where players can purchase in-game packages to boost their progress. The Top Up process works as follows:
- Players choose from available packages (Random Box or Treasure) with different quantities and shield durations.
- Each package has a fixed cost (IDR 50,000 or IDR 100,000) and grants either random boxes or treasures, plus shield protection (6h or 12h).
- After submitting a Top Up request, the player must wait for admin approval.
- Admins can approve or reject requests. Approved requests immediately grant the items and add shield duration (stacking if already active).
- All Top Up transactions are tracked in the player's history, showing package, cost, status, and timestamp.
- The leaderboard (scoreboard) displays total top up amounts for all players, calculated using the actual cost of approved packages.
